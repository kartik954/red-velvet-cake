IF YOU WANT EGG CAKE.
MAKE SURE YOU HAVE HAVE 4 LARGE EGGS.
Separate the eggs before starting. 
Beat the egg yolks with the wet ingredients. 
Then beat the egg whites into fluffy peaks and fold them in last.
 Beating the egg whites incorporates air and promises a velvet-rich texture.
 In my opinion, cream cheese frosting pairs best with red velvet’s flavor and this frosting recipe is really simple. 
 You need block-style cream cheese, butter, confectioners’ sugar, a splash of milk, vanilla extract, and a pinch of salt to offset the sweetness.
 It glides on seamlessly and is silky smooth.
 If you’re looking to pipe decoration with this cream cheese frosting, chill it in the refrigerator for 20 minutes. 
 This guarantees the creamy frosting will hold its shape.
 
 YOUR RED VELVET CAKE IS READY.
